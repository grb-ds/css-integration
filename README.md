# Drill: Learn CSS Integration

- Repository name: `css-integration`
- URL: [CSS Integration](https://grb-ds.github.io/css-integration/)
- Mode: `solo`
- Type of Challenge: `consolidation`
- Duration: `1 day` (half a day per interface)
- Deployment strategy: GitHub Pages

## Before you start

First, [read the criteria](criteria.md) so that you know what is expected of you.  
You got it? Ok, now follow the instructions. Think "pixel-perfect".

## The challenge

In this exercise you will build three full integrations.  
As often is with CSS, this is an exercise in precision and accuracy (and a zest of dementia, because... CSS).

For each interface :

- Create a standard html page based on this template:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Interface #</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Your code here -->
  </body>
</html>
```

- Create a standard `style.css` stylesheet and link it to the html page
- Add the relevant HTML and CSS code so that the end result looks as similar as possible to the provided _high-fidelity mockup_ images.

### Rules

1. This is a `solo` challenge. And since this is also a mock test, you are **not allowed to ask for help** from your fellow juniors this time ãƒ„
2. You are allowed, of course, to use documentation sites, Google, stackoverflow.com and any other resource that you would normally use. Internet is your friend.
3. You _may_ use SASS and/or a CSS framework if it makes the job easier, but it will not give you extra points.
4. Commit (and push) at least once every hour (set a timer to remind you if you need to).
5. If there is anything that you don't understand about this exercise, ask your coach on your promotion's Discord channel!

## Interface 1

Create this view pixel-perfectly. Make it responsive: the grid should stack on small screens.

## Interface 2

Create this view pixel-perfectly.
You can use an image / screenshot for the chart.
Bonus: create the chart blocks in CSS.

## Interface 3

Create this view pixel-perfectly.

## Done?

Are you sure? [Review the criteria](criteria.md) before sending your work to the coaches.

## Really done?

Bravo! These interfaces are not easy ones! Give yourself a big pat on the back, because your CSS muscles seem to be working great! (It's okay if they feel sour...)
